🌊 Real-Time Adaptive Control and Monitoring of Aquaculture Ponds 🐟
 This project focuses on building an IoT- and AI-enabled smart aquaculture system that enables real-time monitoring and adaptive control of pond environments to ensure optimal growth conditions for aquatic life.

🚀 Project Overview:
The system is designed to monitor key pond parameters and environmental conditions in real time and make intelligent suggestions or trigger control actions to maintain ideal conditions. A user-friendly Flutter mobile app integrated with Firebase is developed to visualize live data and provide actionable AI-based insights.

📱 Mobile App Features:
🔹 Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard
Live display of pond and environmental parameters:
1)🌡️ Temperature
2)💧 pH Level
3)🫧 Dissolved Oxygen
4)📶 Water Level
5)🌧️ Rainfall
6)🌬️ Wind Speed
7)⏰ Time of Day
8)🌫️ Air Quality Index
9)⚙️ Motor RPM
10)☠️ Contaminant Detection

🔹 AI-Based Suggestions:
*)Smart alerts and floating notification-style suggestion boxes with emojis for:
*)Low oxygen levels
*)Poor water quality
*)Abnormal motor operation
*)Weather-based recommendations

🔹 Graphical Representation:
Beautiful, labeled graphs for clear visualization of trends and insights.

🔹 Firebase Integration:
Seamless real-time database connectivity for data logging and retrieval.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
*)Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
*)Backend: Firebase (Realtime Database, Firestore, Authentication)
*)Hardware: Microcontroller with sensors (Temperature, pH, DO, Water Level)
*)AI/ML Module: Python (for AI Suggestions & Adaptive Control)
*)Communication: Wi-Fi or GSM module for real-time data transmission

🌟 Goals:
1)Improve water quality management using data-driven decisions
2)Reduce manual monitoring efforts
3)Provide early warnings and adaptive control for pond health
4)Enable scalable and affordable aquaculture solutions
