🌊 Real-Time Adaptive Control and Monitoring of Aquaculture Ponds 🐟
 This project focuses on building an IoT- and AI-enabled smart aquaculture system that enables real-time monitoring and adaptive control of pond environments to ensure optimal growth conditions for aquatic life.

🚀 Project Overview
The system is designed to monitor key pond parameters and environmental conditions in real time and make intelligent suggestions or trigger control actions to maintain ideal conditions. A user-friendly Flutter mobile app integrated with Firebase is developed to visualize live data and provide actionable AI-based insights.

📱 Mobile App Features
🔹 Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard
Live display of pond and environmental parameters:
🌡️ Temperature
💧 pH Level
🫧 Dissolved Oxygen
📶 Water Level
🌧️ Rainfall
🌬️ Wind Speed
⏰ Time of Day
🌫️ Air Quality Index
⚙️ Motor RPM
☠️ Contaminant Detection

🔹 AI-Based Suggestions
Smart alerts and floating notification-style suggestion boxes with emojis for:
Low oxygen levels
Poor water quality
Abnormal motor operation
Weather-based recommendations

🔹 Graphical Representation
Beautiful, labeled graphs for clear visualization of trends and insights.

🔹 Firebase Integration
Seamless real-time database connectivity for data logging and retrieval.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
Backend: Firebase (Realtime Database, Firestore, Authentication)
Hardware: Microcontroller with sensors (Temperature, pH, DO, Water Level)
AI/ML Module: Python (for AI Suggestions & Adaptive Control)
Communication: Wi-Fi or GSM module for real-time data transmission

🌟 Goals
Improve water quality management using data-driven decisions
Reduce manual monitoring efforts
Provide early warnings and adaptive control for pond health
Enable scalable and affordable aquaculture solutions
